Project Description:

The "Minimal" project represents my initial venture into web development, aimed at showcasing fundamental skills and the use of semantic tags to create a static web page. Key features of the project include:

Semantic Tags: To ensure the page's structure and semantics, semantic HTML5 tags such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> have been employed. These tags help appropriately mark different sections of the page.

Sectioned Structure: The page is divided into various sections, each displaying a distinct block of information or content. This approach enhances clear and logical content organization.

Hover Effects: The project utilizes hover effects on specific elements, creating visual changes or animations when the cursor is placed over these elements, adding interactivity.

Single Static Page: The project consists of only one static web page, presenting information and content related to chosen themes or objectives.

First Step in Learning: The "Minimal" project represents a crucial milestone in the journey of learning web development. It serves educational purposes, helping to improve skills and solidify basic HTML and CSS concepts.

This project serves as an introductory step in web development and demonstrates essential concepts required for further advancement in this field
